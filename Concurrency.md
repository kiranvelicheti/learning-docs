# Process
  Program or application running in an environment

# Thread 
 Single task of Execution is a Thread

# Daemon thread 
 A daemon thread runs in background and doesn’t prevent JVM from terminating, child thread created from daemon thread is also a daemon thread.

# multi-threaded programming 
Improves the performance and reduces CPU idle time

# Thread creation 
Implement runnable and extending thread	class

# Life cycle of thread 
New,Runnable,Running,Waiting,Blocked,Dead

# Run method
will act like normal function call

# Start method
creates a thread

# sleep()
pauses the thread

# priority
based on this scheduler will pick a runnable thread

# Context switching 
process of storing and restoring of CPU state so that Thread execution can be resumed from the same point at a later point of time

# join()
u make sure all the threads created by the program is dead before finishing the main function.

# wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
methods allows threads to communicate about the lock status of a resource.

# thread safety  
synchronization, atomic concurrent classes, implementing concurrent Lock interface, using volatile keyword, using immutable classes

# volatile
always reads from memory not from cache

# Synchronized block is better as it won't block object like snchronized method

# Deadlock
programming situation where two or more threads are blocked forever

# thread pool 
manages the pool of worker threads, it contains a queue that keeps tasks waiting to get executed.

# Sleep method
will not release the lock. Wait method releases lock.

# Wait method 
defined in Object class, whereas Sleep method defined in Thread class.
